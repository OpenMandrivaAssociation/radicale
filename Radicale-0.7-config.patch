 # Config file for Radicale - A simple calendar server

-# Place it into /etc/radicale/config (global) 
-# or ~/.config/radicale/config (user)
+# This is a Mandriva specific configuration file. The default
+# configuration file is in /usr/share/doc/radicale/config.default
+# 
+# NOTE:
+# Radicale is intended to run in Mandriva as a service,
+# not started by a regular user. The service is started automatically
+# on boot time or it can be started manually with command
+# 'service radicale start' as root.
 #
-# The current values are the default ones
+# NOTE:
+# To run Radicale as a normal user (and to override the global settings),
+# copy the default config file to ~/.config/radicale/config,
+# modify it and execute /usr/bin/radicale.
