NOTE:
Radicale is intended to run in Mandriva as a service, not started by a
regular user. The service is started automatically on boot time or it
can be started manually with command 'service radicale start' as root.

To run Radicale as a normal user (and to override the global settings), copy
the default config file to ~/.config/radicale/config, modify it (if needed)
and execute /usr/bin/radicale.

The default configuration file is in /usr/share/doc/radicale/config.default
